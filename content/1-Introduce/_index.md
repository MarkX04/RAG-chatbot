**Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbox with highlighted evidence functionality** is an application that requires knowledge in several areas, especially in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This application not only integrates the ability to retrieve information from external databases or knowledge bases, but also utilizes powerful generative models to produce contextually relevant, accurate responses tailored to user needs.

A key highlight of the system is the **highlighted evidence feature**, which enables users to easily identify which parts of the source document were used by the model to generate its response. This feature enhances the systemâ€™s transparency and verifiability, thereby improving trust and user experience.

The following topics will be introduced in the workshop:
- Knowledge of Large Language Models (LLM)
- How to convert PDF documents into a Vector Database (vectordb)
- How Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) works
- Highlighted evidence algorithm
